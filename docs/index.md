# Latest News

## ATLAS 2021-R3 Released

_6th August 2021_

* Alarms behaviour improved
* Distance-mode live &amp; session comparison issues fixed
* Transparently handles PGVs updated with same version
* Full support for OAuth 2.0 RTA Web Services
* RTA Web Services implementation toolkit


<!-- Other things we could do:

* Call to action button? (What would that be?)
* Contact form?
* Resources below the fold (see AWS Copilot page)

Style questions:

* Do we like the carbon fibre background? Seemed better than plain black and less complex than an image.
  But there might be other things we could do. What about a lighter grey?

* How do we feel about the wavy line? I lifted this from https://wtfutil.com/ which itself
  probably took it from https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/. We could make it look
  more like a telemetry line, but the reference might go over peoples' head.

* Better hero image? In general, screenshots don't work at that size.
  Schematic image? Animation?
