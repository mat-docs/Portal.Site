We would like to take this opportunity to get some valuable feedback from you, especially 
significant regressions in key areas (fatal errors, data integrity issues, appearance, 
functionality, performance and scalability, usability, etc.). If you have an automated test suite 
or deployment workflow, run that in addition to your manual testing. If you discover a bug or 
regression, include your testing process and any pertinent information in your issue comment 
so that we can try to reproduce it.
