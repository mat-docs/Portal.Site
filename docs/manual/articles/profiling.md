# Performance and Memory Profilers

## Overview

From version 11.2.3.460 onwards, ATLAS application now includes Jet Brains dotTrace and dotMemory profilers, which can 
be accessed via the Tools menu. 
This function allows users to take snapshots, which can be shared with the ATLAS development team for debugging purposes. 
Please use this feature only when specifically requested by the development team.

!!! warning
    The profilers capture a large amount of information and will generate a large file. Please limit the amount of time 
    metrics are being capture to minimise file size.
